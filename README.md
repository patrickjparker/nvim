# My first adventure into the NeoVim world

I was first inspired to begin this journey by the Primeagen. His video "0 to LSP" is the basis of this config which I have since extended.

## Dependancies
- [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (telescope project level string search)
- [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (For shapes and symbols)

## Possible Future Plugins
- [conflit-marker](https://github.com/rhysd/conflict-marker.vim) - Alternate way of resolving git merge conflicts
- [undo-tree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) - Visualizes undo history
